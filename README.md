# MagicMouse2DriversWin10x64
Drivers that would work with Windows 10 x64 and fix scrolling for Apple Magic Mouse 2

Special thanks to https://github.com/timsutton/brigadier

To install - download both folders, right click on .inf files and Install.

Both vertical & horizontal scrolls now should work on your Windows 10.

Enjoy!
